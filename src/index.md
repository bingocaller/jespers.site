In case the snazzy domain name didn‚Äôt already clue you in, my name is **Jesper**.

I‚Äôm a [front-of-the-front-end developer](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/) who is excited about creating **polished and accessible user experiences** while **doing more with less**.

I believe these things can be achieved through a combination of progressive enhancement, design system thinking, and an iterative process with a short feedback loop.

## Work

These are the (industry) jobs I‚Äôve had so far, in reverse chronological order.

### Issuu

I‚Äôm currently working as a Staff Software Engineer (üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) at [Issuu](https://issuu.com). At time of writing I‚Äôve worked here for nearly five years and am still enjoying it a lot.

I‚Äôve had the chance to work on some really interesting projects, most notably our current design system, [Silkscreen](https://silkscreen.issuu.com), which I helped get off the ground and have been the main driver of from the Engineering side.

As one of the more senior engineers I‚Äôve also had the pleasure of getting to mentor others and help our teams improve their skills either through pair programming sessions, code review, or otherwise leading by example.

### Politiken

Before this, I worked for [Politiken](https://pol.dk), where I helped make the site look good and keep it running fast, while also staying true to our design principles and template framework.

I liked it a lot; not just the work itself, but also collaborating with smart, talented, passionate people who, like me, wanted to improve the product in a sensible manner.

### Autobutler

Before that, I was at [Autobutler](https://autobutler.dk).

When I first started, they hadn‚Äôt had an actual front-end developer for about six months and they didn‚Äôt have any real structure in place for the front-end code.

During my time there, I managed to shape things up and [introduce some more structure](https://autobutler.dk/design) (at least, I like to think I did).

### Lindegaard & Co

My first job out of school was at a small digital agency where I had also interned during my final semester: [Lindegaard & Co.](https://lindegaard.dk)

I worked on a bunch of different projects during my time there and became proficient in Learning by Doing and The Art of Hitting The Ground Running.

Needless to say, I learned a lot and I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am today, had it not been for my time spent there.

## Open source

I love open source software. Not only is it amazing to have access to so much high quality software; open source projects are also a great source of inspiration and learning. To see how other people write their code and how they have solved common (and not so common) problems is priceless to me.

That‚Äôs why I try to put as much of my own stuff out there as I possibly can. It makes me want to try harder and do better. Who knows? Maybe one day my code can inspire someone else.

In recent years my side projects increasingly end up lingering in a half-finished state on my local machine instead of being published for others to use and scrutinise. I‚Äôd love to make more of these ideas public but everyday obligations eat away at my bandwidth!

Anyways, here are a few of my own projects that have actually been published:

### [Hex Clock](https://github.com/bingocaller/hex-clock)

Originally created by [Jacobo Col√≤](https://jacopocolo.com/hexclock/), but I changed it slightly for my own purposes. Works great as a screen saver via [WebViewScreenSaver](https://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver) (unfortunately, this no longer works under macOS Catalina). There‚Äôs also a [live wallpaper version](https://github.com/bingocaller/hex_clock_wallpaper).

### [This site](https://github.com/bingocaller/jespers.site)

I use my personal site to test out various technologies. This iteration is generated using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), the previous one was a [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) app.

### [Bingo](https://github.com/bingocaller/bingo)

A quick bingo caller app I made for me and my co-workers when we were doing a remote bingo session. Made for [90-ball bingo](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(British_version)>).

You can try it out at [bingo.jespers.site](https://bingo.jespers.site)!

### [Betrayal PWA](https://github.com/bingocaller/betrayal-pwa)

A [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps), which can help keep track of character stats when playing [Betrayal at House on the Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betrayal_at_House_on_the_Hill).
