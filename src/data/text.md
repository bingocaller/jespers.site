In case the snazzy domain name didn't already clue you in, my name is Jesper. I'm a front-end developer who cares about **code structure/maintainability** and **user experience**. {paragraph}

I believe that without proper structure, you're not going to be able to deliver the best possible user experience. The better structure you have in your code, the easier it is to maintain it; the more maintainable your code is, the more time you can spend improving performance, polish, and the overall user experience. As I see it, good user experience is a consequence of well-written, well-structured code. {paragraph}

### Work {subject-headline}

Currently, I work for [Politiken](//pol.dk), where I help make the site look good and keep it running fast, while also staying true to our design principles and template framework. I like it a lot; not just the work itself, but also collaborating with smart, talented, passionate people who also want to carry the product forward in the most sensible manner. {paragraph}

Before that, I was at [Autobutler](//autobutler.dk). When I first started, they hadn't had an actual front-end developer for about six months and they didn't have any real structure in place for the front-end code. During my time there, I managed to shape things up and [introduce some more structure](//autobutler.dk/design)
(at least, I like to think I did). {paragraph}

My first job out of school was at a small digital agency where I had also interned during my final semester: [Lindegaard & Co.](//lindegaard.dk)
I worked on a bunch of different projects during my time there. I became proficient in Learning by Doing and The Art of Hitting The Ground Running.  
Needless to say, I learned a lot and I wouldn't be where I am today, had it not been for my time spent there. {paragraph}

### Open source {subject-headline}

I love open source software.  
Not only is it amazing to have access to so much high quality software; open source projects are also a great source of inspiration. To see how other people write their code and how they have solved common (and not so common) problems is priceless to me. {paragraph}

That's why I try to put as much of my own stuff out there as I possibly can. It makes me want to try harder and do better. Who knows? Maybe one day my code can inspire someone else. {paragraph}

I try to contribute wherever I can, whenever I have the time. So far, I've made some minor contributions to projects like [Vimium](//github.com/philc/vimium), [KE-complex_modifications](//github.com/pqrs-org/KE-complex_modifications), and [convert-bootstrap-2-to-3](//github.com/natecavanaugh/convert-bootstrap-2-to-3). I'd like to do more, though; it's a matter of finding, and/or prioritising the time. {paragraph}

Here are a few of my own projects: {paragraph}

* [Hex Clock](//github.com/bingocaller/hex-clock)  
Originally created by [Jacobo Colò](//jacopocolo.com/hexclock/), but I changed it slightly for my own purposes. Works great as a screensaver via [WebViewScreenSaver](//github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver). There's also a [live wallpaper version](//github.com/bingocaller/hex_clock_wallpaper).
* [Politiken RSS](//github.com/bingocaller/pol-rss)  
A very simplified view of the latest headlines from politiken.dk. An excuse for me to play around with CSS Grid, `async`/`await`, and `fetch`.
* [Betrayal PWA](//github.com/bingocaller/betrayal-pwa)  
A (Progressive) Web App, which can help keep track of character stats when playing [Betrayal at House on the Hill](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betrayal_at_House_on_the_Hill).
